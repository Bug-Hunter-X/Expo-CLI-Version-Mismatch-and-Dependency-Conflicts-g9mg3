To fix this, ensure all your dependencies are compatible by checking your `package.json`.  Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to investigate the dependency tree.  If there are version conflicts, update your dependencies to compatible versions. You might need to run `expo upgrade` to update the Expo CLI itself.  If problems persist, try cleaning your cache using `expo start --clear` or deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling packages.  Manually deleting `node_modules/.expo` can also resolve some cache-related issues.  Make sure you're using the correct version of node and npm.  Consider using a version manager like nvm (Node Version Manager). Sometimes deleting your `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file and reinstalling all dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn` can resolve seemingly intractable dependency issues.
