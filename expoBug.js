This error typically occurs when you have a mismatch between the versions of Expo CLI and the project's dependencies.  The Expo CLI might try to use a version of a library that's not compatible with the version specified in your `package.json` file.  Another cause could be an issue with the way your project is structured, particularly if you've manually modified Expo's internal directories or files.
